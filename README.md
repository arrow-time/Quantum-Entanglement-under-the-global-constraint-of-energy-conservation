# Quantum Entanglement under the global constraint of energy conservation without violating local causality

Previous sections have explicitly emphasized that this model focuses on local interactions in space and time, and introducing non-local relationships poses significant challenges to the model’s computability and physical intuitiveness. However, since quantum entanglement has been widely experimentally verified, the following presents only a conceptual interpretive framework, without delving into detailed analysis.

As discussed in earlier chapters such as Chapter 3 and Chapter 13, the system's evolution is primarily driven by entropy increase and maximum entropy path selection at the quantum level—governed by local energy conduction rules derived from the second law of thermodynamics. So, what then is the nature of entangled states—manifestly non-local correlations—within this model? Do genuine non-local interactions actually exist?

We present a simplified case where the energy states of two distant quantum sites become correlated, without invoking non-local interactions.

Comparison Table of Evolutionary Paths under Local Energy Transfer Rules (as per Chapter 3) using Multiplicative Entropy (S = Πmᵢ)

Item	Initial State： ───────────────T₁────────────── Path A (State T₂) ────────────────	Path B (State T₂)

SEQ State： ─────────────────[5, 7, 1, 7, 3] ────────── [5, 6, 2, 6, 4]	─────────────────── [6, 6, 2, 6, 3]

Entropy S：	──────────────────── 735 ───────────────── 1440 ─────────────────────── 1296

Entropy Increase ΔS：	  ────────────── --	─────────────────── 705 ──────────────────────── 561

Multiple transfer pairs with the maximum energy difference (7→1) exist. Both Path A and Path B satisfy the energy transfer rules mentioned in Chapter 3, including the rule of prioritizing the maximum energy difference between adjacent sites (the maximum entropy path selection rule).

Based on the table above, we can observe that from the T1 [7,1,7] structure to the T2 [6,2,6] structure, sites 2 to 4 maintain symmetry. Furthermore, under both potential Path A and Path B at T2, sites 2-4 are [6,2,6]. This symmetry arises because the energy difference between sites 2 & 3 and sites 4 & 3 is greater than the energy difference between site 2 & site 1 and site 4 & site 5.

Under this model, as long as the condition for maintaining this symmetry holds, the energy states of site 1 and site 5 are in a correlated state.
When the symmetry from site 2 to site 4 is broken – for instance, measuring site 1 essentially inputs energy into it; if the energy of site 1 becomes greater than that of site 2 – then at the next moment, this symmetry is broken, and the complementary dual state between site 1 and site 5 is broken.

The above example and discussion equivalently demonstrate that, under the global energy conservation constraint, the local symmetry of the energy distribution generates an energy distribution symmetric configuration. The sites at both ends of this symmetric configuration form an energy state correlation, which is essentially the global energy conservation between site 1 and site 5. Due to the symmetry of the energy distribution from site 2 to site 4, the global energy conservation is compressed into the energy correlation between site 1 and site 5.

As long as the symmetry of the energy distribution configuration is not broken – even if site 1 is measured and a small amount of energy is input, provided the symmetry of the relevant energy distribution configuration in the next evolutionary moment is not broken – site 1 and site 5 remain correlated. Furthermore, although site 1 and site 5 are not adjacent, this correlation requires no non-local interactions.

The explanation for the entangled state provided above should be self-consistent and offer a clear picture. The global constraint of energy conservation fundamentally originates from the postulate of global topological invariance in this model.

This explanation accounts for the correlation of entangled states from the perspective of global energy conservation, without introducing non-local interactions that could potentially invalidate existing theories.

The next step is to see if relevant experimental phenomena can be found to verify or falsify it.
